I’m a 3rd-year Ph.D. student in [Conversational AI Group](http://coai.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/), Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University. I’m advised by Prof. [Minlie Huang](http://coai.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/hml). My research interests mainly include safety and alignment of large language models and AI agents.
